# CrimeAnalysis-Tableau
Designed and developed an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyzed crime trends, patterns, and hotspots.

Action 
1. Overall Crime Statistics Dashboard: 
a. For personnel and resource management, the department needs to 
understand the count and types of crimes reported across the city. 
Mark the locations on a geo-map highlighting the locations with recent 
criminal history. 
b. Identify the most common criminal incidents reported   
c. In this introductory dashboard, include a live crime feed to exhibit the 
total number of crimes reported to date for the current year and the 
most recently reported crimes with their time and locations

2. Time Period Analysis Dashboard: 
Along with locations, the study of crime statistics across time statistics is also 
crucial for understanding the patterns and planning those preventive strategies.  
a. Study distribution count of crime incidents across different time periods, 
such as day of the week or hour 
b. Further, explore the percentage of incident reporting for several time 
blocks (morning, afternoon, evening, and night)

3. Trend Analysis Dashboard: 
a. Create a dashboard to study the change in crime rate over different years 
b. Compare the change in the incident reporting over the years for the same 
date and time

4. Comparative Analysis:
a. Study the distribution of incidents reported where an arrest was made 
vs. not 
b. Identify what percentage of the reported incidents under each incident 
category are severe 
c. To make the dashboard interactive, provide filters for incident type 
and location in these dashboards for a granular study
